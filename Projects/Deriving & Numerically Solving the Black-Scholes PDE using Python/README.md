# Deriving & Numerically Solving the Black-Scholes PDE Using Python

## üìò Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **mathematical derivation** and **numerical implementation** of the **Black‚ÄìScholes Partial Differential Equation (PDE)** ‚Äî the cornerstone of modern option pricing theory.

It includes:
- Analytical formulation of the Black-Scholes PDE
- Finite Difference Method (explicit scheme) for numerical solution
- Visualization of the evolution of the option price over time
- Comparison between analytical and numerical results
